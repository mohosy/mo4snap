Hi Snap Team,

I just wanted to sincerely apologize for submitting this updated version after the deadline.

I originally built two separate scenes — Scene 1 as the intro and Scene 2 as the core catalog functionality. My plan was to merge them on Tuesday, but I ran into technical issues I couldn’t solve in time. Out of hesitation and fear of missing the deadline completely, I submitted only Scene 2.

Scene 1 was already finished — it’s just a visual intro to give context and emotion to what Scene 2 is about. I’m now pushing the merged version on Wednesday at 4:55 PM in hopes that someone might still view it as a full experience.

I’m not trying to make anything unfair or break the rules. I’ve just worked incredibly hard on this, and I wanted to give it the best chance to be understood.

Thank you for understanding, and regardless of the outcome, I truly appreciate the opportunity.

– Mo
